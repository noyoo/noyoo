  <h3>Who are you?</h3>
  <p>I am a Mechatronic Engineer, currently enrolled in a masters course at AGH UST in Kraków, Poland. I am looking for every opportunity to learn, improve, and broaden my horizons</p>

  <h3>What are you doing?</h3>
  <p>That's a good question! As an active member of AGH Racing - a Formula Student team, I spend most of my time on developing a 4x4 electric race car. In my spare time, I also create widgets for Twitch streamers, and work on some personal projects. Those include:
    <ul>
<!--       <li>🌐 Writing a NEAT neural network algorithm from scratch in C++</li> -->
      <li>⏱️ Creating a wireless, multi-point time measurement system (my Engineering Thesis)</li>
<!--       <li>🥣 Developing the Oatronic - an intuitive oatmeal machine (it's a class project)</li> -->
      <li>🔫 Developing a game in Unreal Engine 5 - a multiplayer FPS with a cool twist</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>What are your skills?</h3>
  <p>Well, when it comes to programming, I use C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MATLAB on an almost daily basis. Apart from that I have a very good knowledge of SOLIDWORKS and Siemens NX. I am currently learning Altium Designer</p>
